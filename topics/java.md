Make a git repo by the name of java-demo
For each question-type, make a corresponding file for that, having 5 answers/questions in each file.
and save the same in git.
A total of 14 commits must be there, in a clean and presentable manner with each commit showing the answers of one topic.

For each topic, you've to make a Pull Request, and make a commit for each of the 5 answers solved for the same.
Hint -> Use the branch checkout, and merge features to do this.
```

## Springboot
```
- Define @entity class
    - user table - design a table with created_time, updated_time, name, phone number, city, isDeleted
        - @uniqueConstraint (combination of 2 cols (name & phone number) should be unique)

- Write 4 api's to CRUD on a table.
    - create - send the dto back on creation.
    - read - get all records where isDeleted = False
        - read/user_id - to send back only 1 single record.
    - update - only the city column can be updated.
        - on updation, updated_time value should change.
    - delete - update isDelete flag to true (understand hard-delete vs soft-delete)
    - host all 4 url's on swagger.
    - dto, service, serviceImpl usages will be covered.

- flyway integration
    - how to add new tables?
        - add a new table user_country - user_id (FK to user), country
    - how to alter existing table? - rename the column city to currentCity, and add a new column - nativeCity
        = only the currentCity can be updated in the PUT api written before.

- Change the returntype of a user object in /user_id to jsonNode.
- use ObjectMapper to do this.

- Write a custom annotation on GET call (/user_id) to check if the user city is "BLR" then print logs on terminal saying - "User needs to be warned of flooding"

- write custom exception handler to send this exception if user_id is not found. "User might be deleted or does not exist in db"

- Integrate external service - kafka
    - each time a user info is updated, send a record to kafka of this data type format where the values from currentCity will be used.
        - {"userid": 1, "pastCityWas": "", newCityIs: ""}

- Work on task schedulers - db_scheduler library
    - make a simple task to print "Hi! I've started running", for 5 seconds, by putting sleep.
    - design a reporting table - with task name, start time, end time, status, id
    - create an enum file with statuses - STARTED, RUNNING, DONE
    - for each run, an entry should be created in the reportingTable.

- Make a mock table and insert 50000 records in that, with simple 2-3 columns.
    - download some mock excel/csv file from internet with num of records > 40-50K.
    - write an automated script to insert all the records in batches of 500. can be any kind of script.
    - write a sql query "select * from table", and read it in batches of 1000. for each batch of records - print batchId.
        - if there are 50K records, then 50K/1K = 50 batch Id's will be printed on screen.

- add logging to the codebase.
    - for each day a single file should be generated.
    - for each log line - name of class, and function name should be printed.
```
