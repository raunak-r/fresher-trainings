## Part A (Python) - Day 1
```
1. Local Installation
Refer [Python & Pycharm Setup in Windows](https://gist.github.com/raunak-r/15fb871765e56ebe7a05bb6f42fc24d2)
```


## Part B (Data) - Day 2
A small project has to be created in Django now. There will be 2 components (Data & APIs to serve that data), one for each day, and 2 days for spillovers.

Follow these 2 articles completely.
1. [Django project creation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/)
2. [SQL Table Design](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial02/)
At the end of this, you should have the same screenshots as shown in the blog running on your localhost in chrome - 

```
Enhancement Task - Make 2 more tables in the same models.py
An Employee table with at least 5 fields
A project table with at least 2 fields.
Constraints - A project cannot be created without 0 employees associated with it.
An employee will work on only one project
```
Refer [Link](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/examples/many_to_one/) for this task.


## Part C (API) - Day 3

Now you've 3 tables in your models.py.
Follow this article, follow the page completely, make new tables if you want, or change the table names as per your project table names. leave the 'post' functions. Work on 'GET' API.
- Refer [Link](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial03/)

At the end of the day - you should have at-least 3 GET API's, one each for each table.
From postman, on calling that API, all the data from that table should be returned.


## Day 4 & 5

1. Import the whole django project to GIT, and send link. Make the project clean and presentable. 
2. Setup and get familiar with Jupyter Notebook Usage 
    - Refer [link](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)
    - Task - Import all the singleton python code written for questions to a notebook and make it clean and presentable.
3. Create a new notebook and practice pandas.
    - Task 1 - [Basic Pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas)
