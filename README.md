## Trainings

Being a fresher, we come across a million question, How to deep dive into large codebases, how to start learning something. Given the amount of technologies that exist today it all may feel really overwhelming.

Frontend, backend, sql, postman, intellij, visual code, so many new words and there's no clarity. Plus there's a plethora of IDE's that exist. Just getting your hands on them feels like a task right?

Now imagine, your peers who work in a different industry. Think about civil, or mechanical or chemical. How do they work? And they work in 10 times more complicated industries than us. They have to first visit the problem station barefoot or via transport and then solve everything under sweat. How do they feel?

You'll realize that they have a set of tools and principles with them. Software industries don't prepare you much for this basic training, most people don't know if they can install email clients on their phone also, but everyone knows how to pick up an urgent office call in other industries.

S, let's see what tools and mindsets can help you prepare better in this software industry.

```
1. Basic laptop. What are windows? What is ubuntu?
2. Can you open a terminal in a particular folder without typing the file path?
3. What is cmd vs bash vs prompt. Why do we even have the blue colour terminal?
4. What is your typing skill? How many words can you type in a minute? Use -> https://www.keybr.com/
5. Are you good with a touchpad or a mouse?
```

Ask yourself these and make an active effort on daily basis to be better at this. It's no different from knowing your wrench, or hammer or the tool belt that a core industry engineer wears for the rest of his life.

Next is software concepts.
```
1. What is the backend?
2. Are the languages that you know a part of the backend or frontend?
3. Which came first? Database or backend?
4. When starting a new project, what will you design first?
5. How to start learning a new skill.
6. Take a look at https://roadmap.sh and pick your path and identify what all things you've heard about.
```

The point of this training is to prepare you for this industry. Think of this knowledge as the basic maths that is required in order to solve algebra. Try not to feel overwhelmed, but try to take it all in a good spirits, and with practice you'll start understanding how many different pieces come together to build an application.
