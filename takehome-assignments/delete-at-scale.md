# Auto-Complete Search
We would like you to implement an auto-complete search feature for our web application. This feature should provide real-time suggestions to users as they type into a search box. Assume that we have a large dataset of searchable items stored in a database.

## Please implement the following:
```
An endpoint that accepts a query string parameter and returns a list of suggestions based on the input.
The search should be case-insensitive and match items that start with the input query.
Limit the number of suggestions to 10.
Implement a front-end component (using a framework of your choice, e.g., React, Vue.js, or plain JavaScript) that interacts with this endpoint and displays the suggestions in a dropdown below the search box as the user types.
You can use any additional libraries or tools you find necessary. Please write the complete code for both the back-end and front-end components, including any necessary setup, routes, and helper functions.
```

## Follow-up Questions:
```
How would you optimize the search to handle a large number of records efficiently?
What considerations would you make for deploying this feature in a production environment?
How would you handle edge cases, such as network delays or failures?
How would you ensure the security of the search endpoint, especially if dealing with sensitive data?
```
