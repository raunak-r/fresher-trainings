# OTP Service
We need you to implement an OTP (One-Time Password) service using Flask and Redis. This service should generate OTPs for user authentication and store them temporarily in Redis.

## Please implement the following:
```
Generate OTP: Create an endpoint that accepts a user's identifier (e.g., email or phone number) and generates a 6-digit OTP.

Store the OTP in Redis with a TTL (Time To Live) of 5 minutes.
Return a success message to the client.
Validate OTP: Create an endpoint that accepts the user's identifier and the OTP.

Verify the OTP against the stored value in Redis.
Return a success message if the OTP is valid or an error message if it is invalid or expired.
```

## Requirements:
```
Use Flask to create the web service.
Use Redis for storing OTPs with appropriate expiration.
Implement proper error handling and validation.
Ensure that OTPs are unique and securely generated.
Please provide the complete code for the Flask application, including any necessary setup, routes, and helper functions.
```

## Follow-up Questions:
```
How would you ensure the security of the OTP generation and validation process?
What strategies would you use to prevent abuse of the OTP generation endpoint (e.g., rate limiting)?
How would you handle scenarios where Redis is temporarily unavailable?
How would you scale this service to handle a high volume of requests?
```
