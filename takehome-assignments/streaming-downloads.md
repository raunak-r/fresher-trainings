## Java Downloads
Your task is to set up a project that accomplishes a streaming download architecture in Java.

----------------------------------------------------
## Project -
```
- Create a small frontend project in Angular or React with a single homepage, and 1 single button with the text "Download".
- On click of the button, a GET request will be fired to the Java backend.
Phase 1  - The backend will have an offline zip file of more than 2000 MB (you can source any zip file), and upon receiving the GET request, it will start downloading the file via streaming on the client side.
Phase 2 - On completion of the download, Java backend will send a notification to the client with the message - "Success".
```

## Deliverable 
- You may create a repository on your personal github, and create 2 folders, 1 each for backend and frontend in the same repo with all the codes. You're expected to have a minimum of 5 commits, to show how the code has grown over the course of your project
