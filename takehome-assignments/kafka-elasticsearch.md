# Kafka ElasticSearch 
We need you to implement a data pipeline using Kafka and Elasticsearch. The goal is to stream data from a Kafka topic into an Elasticsearch index for real-time search and analytics.

## Please implement the following:
```
Kafka Producer: Create a Kafka producer that sends JSON-formatted data to a Kafka topic named logs. The data should include fields like timestamp, level (e.g., INFO, ERROR), message, and source.

Kafka Consumer: Create a Kafka consumer that listens to the logs topic, processes the incoming messages, and indexes them into an Elasticsearch index named log_data.

Elasticsearch Setup: Ensure that the log_data index in Elasticsearch has the appropriate mappings to handle the data fields (timestamp, level, message, source).
```

## Requirements:
```
Use appropriate Kafka libraries for producer and consumer implementation.
Use Elasticsearch client libraries to interact with Elasticsearch.
Implement error handling and logging in both producer and consumer.
Ensure that the data is indexed in Elasticsearch in near real-time.
Please provide the complete code for the Kafka producer, Kafka consumer, and Elasticsearch setup, including any necessary configuration files and setup instructions.
```

## Follow-up Questions:
```
How would you ensure the reliability and durability of the data pipeline?
What strategies would you use to handle failures in the Kafka consumer or Elasticsearch indexing?
How would you handle data schema changes in the Kafka topic?
How would you scale this pipeline to handle high throughput and large volumes of data?
```
