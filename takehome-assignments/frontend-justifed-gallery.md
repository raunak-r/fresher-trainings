# Frontend Assignment: Implement a Justified Gallery in Angular

## Overview
```
This assignment is designed to evaluate your skills in Angular, HTML, CSS, and your ability to create custom components and layout logic.
You are required to implement a Justified Gallery from scratch without using any third-party libraries that directly solve this problem.
The gallery should be able to switch between horizontal and vertical layouts dynamically.
```

## Requirements
```
Technology Stack: Angular (latest version), TypeScript, HTML, CSS/SCSS.
Time Estimate: 2-3 days.
Deliverables: A fully functional Angular application, with all required functionality implemented. Include a README.md file explaining your approach, any challenges faced, and how to run the application.
```

## Detailed Requirements

### Gallery Layout:
```
Implement a justified gallery that arranges images in rows (horizontal mode) or columns (vertical mode) such that all rows/columns are of equal width/height. Images within a row/column should be scaled proportionally to maintain their aspect ratio.
The gallery should not use any pre-built gallery or layout libraries for this purpose. All layout calculations should be done manually within your code.
```

## Switching Between Layouts:
```
The user should be able to switch between horizontal and vertical gallery layouts using a toggle button.
The layout switch should be smooth and without significant lag or jank.
```

## Image Source:
```
You can use a static array of image URLs (you may use placeholder images from services like https://picsum.photos/ or any other image source).
The array should contain at least 10 images with varying aspect ratios.
```

## Responsive Design:
```
The gallery should be responsive, meaning it should adjust properly to different screen sizes.
Ensure that the gallery looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
```

## Code Quality:
```
Code should be well-structured and modular, following Angular best practices.
Proper use of Angular components, directives, and services where appropriate.
Write clear and concise comments to explain complex sections of the code.
Implement error handling where necessary.
```

### Bonus Points
Accessibility: Make the gallery accessible to users with disabilities (consider keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, etc.).

## Submission Instructions
```
Repository: Create a public GitHub repository and push your code there. Share the link to the repository.
Documentation: Include a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run your application, as well as any design or architectural decisions you made.
Demo: (Optional) If possible, deploy your application to a live environment (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) and share the live link.
```

## Evaluation Criteria
```
Functionality: Does the gallery work as expected? Does it handle different image sizes and aspect ratios well?
Code Quality: Is the code clean, readable, and well-organized? Are best practices followed?
UI/UX: Is the gallery visually appealing and user-friendly? Are transitions smooth?
Problem-Solving: How well did you solve the layout problem? Did you implement the layout logic correctly?
```
Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your submission!
